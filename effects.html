        <h2>Effects of Air Pollution</h2>
        <div class="effect-item">
            <h3>1. Respiratory Issues</h3>
            <p>Long-term exposure to air pollution can lead to a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic bronchitis, and other respiratory diseases. Pollutants such as particulate matter and ozone can irritate the respiratory system, causing difficulty in breathing and worsening existing conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="effect-item">
            <h3>2. Environmental Damage</h3>
            <p>Air pollution has severe consequences for the environment. Acid rain, a result of pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, damages soil, harms plant life, and contaminates water bodies. Pollutants in the air also contribute to smog formation and disrupt ecosystems, impacting both flora and fauna.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="effect-item">
            <h3>3. Climate Change</h3>
            <p>Greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane, contribute to global warming and climate change. This results in rising temperatures, melting ice caps and glaciers, sea-level rise, and shifts in weather patterns. The impact is felt worldwide, affecting ecosystems, agriculture, and human communities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="effect-item">
            <h3>4. Cardiovascular Health</h3>
            <p>Air pollution is not only a threat to respiratory health but also linked to cardiovascular issues. Fine particulate matter can enter the bloodstream and affect the heart, leading to conditions like heart attacks and strokes. Prolonged exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.</p>
