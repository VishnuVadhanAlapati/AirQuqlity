        <h2>Preventing Air Pollution</h2>
        
        <div class="prevention-item">
            <h3>1. Sustainable Transportation</h3>
            <p>Choose eco-friendly modes of transportation such as electric vehicles, bicycles, or public transit. Carpooling and reducing unnecessary travel can also help decrease vehicle emissions, a major contributor to air pollution.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prevention-item">
            <h3>2. Energy Efficiency</h3>
            <p>Improve energy efficiency in homes and businesses by using energy-efficient appliances, proper insulation, and renewable energy sources. This reduces the reliance on fossil fuels and decreases air pollution.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prevention-item">
            <h3>3. Waste Management</h3>
            <p>Adopt responsible waste management practices, including recycling and proper disposal of hazardous materials. Landfills and incineration contribute to air pollution, so reducing waste is essential.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prevention-item">
            <h3>4. Planting Trees</h3>
            <p>Trees act as natural air purifiers by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Planting and maintaining trees in urban and rural areas can significantly contribute to cleaner air.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prevention-item">
            <h3>5. Regulatory Compliance</h3>
            <p>Support and comply with environmental regulations. Governments and regulatory bodies play a crucial role in establishing and enforcing policies that limit emissions from industries and other sources.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prevention-item">
            <h3>6. Education and Awareness</h3>
            <p>Raise awareness about air pollution and its impacts. Educate communities, businesses, and individuals about sustainable practices and the importance of reducing their carbon footprint.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prevention-item">
            <h3>7. Sustainable Agriculture</h3>
            <p>Agricultural activities can contribute to air pollution through the release of ammonia and other pollutants. Implementing sustainable farming practices and reducing the use of chemical fertilizers can help mitigate these impacts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="prevention-item">
            <h3>8. Technology and Innovation</h3>
            <p>Support and invest in technologies that reduce emissions, improve energy efficiency, and promote sustainable development. Innovation plays a crucial role in finding cleaner solutions to current environmental challenges.</p>
        </div>
